    <p>Welcome to our lil Bun Sim! Add new buns with that fancy shmancy spawn button! Change what bunny you're spawning with the drop down. Tired of light theme? Change the time of day with the drop down!</p>

    <p>Curious about one of the little buns? Click them with your mouse! If the bunnies out eat the grass, they might starve. But that's fine! Don't worry about it!</p>
